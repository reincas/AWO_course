Slides for the lecture module "Maxwell Equations" in the course "Applied Wave Optics":

The lecture module provides a rigorous introduction to Maxwell's equations as the theoretical foundation for wave optics. It defines the four fundamental differential equations—Gauss's law, Gauss's law for magnetism, Faraday's law, and the Ampère-Maxwell law—while identifying the key vector fields including electric field strength, magnetic induction, and displacement fields. The electromagnetic fields interact with matter through the concepts of polarisation and magnetisation. Using Taylor expansions for susceptibility tensors, the material distinguishes between static, linear, and non-linear dependencies, ultimately establishing the simplified scalar relationships for relative permittivity and permeability in isotropic, linear media. A significant portion of the module is dedicated to mathematical approaches. The continuity equation is demonstrating the fundamental link between current density and the temporal variation of electrical charge. Finally, the lecture derives the essential boundary conditions for electromagnetic waves at the interface between different materials. By applying the theorems of Stokes and Gauss to infinitesimal surfaces and volumes, it is shown that the parallel components of the electric and magnetic fields, as well as the perpendicular components of the displacement and magnetic induction fields, remain continuous across a boundary.

Slides for the lecture module "Wave Equation" in the course "Applied Wave Optics":

The lecture module details the derivation and application of the electromagnetic wave equation, establishing the theoretical framework for wave propagation in linear, isotropic, homogeneous, and temporally static media. It is demonstrated how the electric and magnetic field vectors satisfy the second-order partial differential wave equation, while noting the specific material constraints that limit its validity compared to the more general Maxwell equations. The module introduces harmonic fields as fundamental solutions, explaining how arbitrary temporal signals can be decomposed into Fourier components. This leads to the derivation of the Helmholtz equations, which govern the spatial behaviour of fields at a single frequency. Building upon these concepts, the module explores plane waves as a crucial theoretical tool. Although plane waves are idealised infinite entities, their linear superposition allows for the description of any physically valid wave form. Key parameters such as the wave vector, wavelength, and the dispersion relation are defined, alongside an explanation of how the complex wave number incorporates small-signal attenuation or gain. Finally, the module examines the intrinsic relationship between electric and magnetic fields within an electromagnetic wave. It defines the field impedance as the ratio of the field magnitudes and derives the refractive index as a function of the material's relative permittivity and permeability. The vacuum impedance is highlighted as a universal constant, providing a baseline for calculating the propagation characteristics of light in various media.

Slides for the lecture module "Waves at Interfaces" in the course "Applied Wave Optics":

The lecture module provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of electromagnetic wave behaviour at the interface between two linear, isotropic, and homogeneous media. It establishes the mathematical foundation for understanding how light is reflected and transmitted by examining both Transverse Electric (TE) and Transverse Magnetic (TM) polarisation states or s-polarised and p-polarised light, respectively. By applying the electromagnetic boundary conditions derived from Maxwell's equations, the fundamental laws of geometric optics, including the law of reflection and Snell’s law are derived. These conditions further lead to the derivation of the Fresnel equations, which quantify the reflection and transmission coefficients for both electric and magnetic field magnitudes and phases. Special attention is given to the phenomenon of total internal reflection, which occurs when light travels from a medium of higher refractive index to one of lower index at an incidence angle exceeding a specific critical value. The module details how this process results in a complete reflection of energy accompanied by a polarisation-dependent phase shift. Additionally, the existence of the Brewster angle is explored, demonstrating that p-polarised light can achieve zero reflection at a specific angle determined by the ratio of the refractive indices. The physical implications of these interactions are further analysed using the Poynting vector to describe energy flux and radiation intensity. The module concludes with illustrating the power reflection factor and phase shift with respect to the angle of incidence at an interface.

AWO-04
Slides for the lecture module "Film Waveguides" in the course "Applied Wave Optics":

The lecture module provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of dielectric film waveguides, the simplest form of optical containment using layered materials. It introduces the three-layer architecture consisting of a high-index film sandwiched between a substrate and cladding, establishing the refractive index conditions necessary for wave-guiding. The module categorises propagation into free waves, substrate waves, and trapped film waves based on the angle of incidence relative to the critical angles for total internal reflection. The core of the module focuses on the mathematical derivation of waveguide modes. It explains how a guided wave is formed by the superposition of two plane waves, resulting in a standing wave pattern in the lateral direction and a travelling wave along the longitudinal axis. This leads to the formulation of the characteristic equation, which incorporates polarisation-dependent phase shifts at the interfaces to define discrete transversal waveguide modes. Since this equation lacks an analytical solution, the module graphical solution. A universal numerical approach using dimensionless variables: the V-number for frequency, the asymmetry parameter for material differences, and the phase parameter for mode propagation is also discussed. The module further details the physical characteristics of these modes, defining the cut-off wavelength and the conditions for single-mode versus multimode operation. It describes the spatial distribution of the electromagnetic fields, highlighting the existence of evanescent fields that protrude into the surrounding media via exponential decay. The module concludes with a systematic algorithm for calculating mode shapes, propagation constants, and effective refractive indices, providing a complete framework for designing and analysing planar integrated optical systems.

AWO-05
Slides for the lecture module "Channel Waveguides" in the course "Applied Wave Optics":

The lecture module examines the principles of channel waveguides and optical fibres, extending the theory of dielectric containment to structures with two-dimensional lateral confinement. It begins with an analysis of rectangular waveguides, utilising the weakly guiding approximation to model modes as combinations of two independent, perpendicular film waveguides. This approach defines two sets of hybrid modes, classified as HE or EH depending on the orientation of the horizontal and vertical polarisation states. The module also reviews common fabrication architectures for planar integrated optics, including strip, buried, and rib waveguide structures. A significant portion of the module is dedicated to circular waveguides, specifically step-index optical fibres. The transition to cylindrical coordinates necessitates the use of Bessel functions to solve the wave equation, replacing trigonometric and exponential functions with Bessel and modified Bessel functions of various orders. These mathematical tools describe the oscillating field profiles within the fibre core and the evanescent decay in the cladding. Guided waves are classified using the LP mode scheme, which is defined by angular and radial mode numbers. Finally, the module explores the spatial field distributions of these modes and relates core and cladding propagation parameters to the characteristic V-number of the fibre.

AWO-06
Slides for the lecture module "Mode Decomposition" in the course "Applied Wave Optics":

The lecture module provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for mode decomposition within optical waveguides featuring arbitrary lateral refractive index distributions. It establishes that the solutions to Maxwell’s equations for such structures form a complete set of orthonormal base functions, consisting of both discrete guided modes and a continuous range of unguided radiation modes. The module details the process of normalising these modes based on their transversal power and demonstrates how any arbitrary wave propagating along an optical axis can be uniquely expressed as a linear superposition of these base functions using specific weight factors. The module further examines the practical implications of mode expansion, particularly regarding coupling and propagation losses. It explains how end face incoupling results in a certain amount of power loss when the incident wave does not perfectly match the specific guided mode field profiles. Additionally, the module identifies various physical mechanisms that trigger mode conversion and radiation loss, such as waveguide curvature, microscopic interface deformations, and periodic modulations. The module concludes by exploring the application of distributed feedback structures, where periodic interface modulations are strategically used in single-mode laser diodes to provide frequency selection and minimise spectral bandwidth.

AWO-07
Slides for the lecture module "Waveguide Coupling" in the course "Applied Wave Optics":

The lecture module provides a comprehensive technical overview of optical signal transfer mechanisms between waveguides, exploring both axial and lateral coupling strategies. It begins by examining butt-coupling, where direct contact between disparate waveguides inevitably results in radiation losses as the mode from the first waveguide is distributed across the entire spectrum of the second. To address these inefficiencies, the module introduces taper coupling, demonstrating through Gaussian field approximations that a series of infinitesimal steps, forming an adiabatic taper, can facilitate a nearly lossless transition between specific pairs of modes. When a laser beam is coupled into a waveguide, the mode-field overlap is crucial for maximum efficiency. Mathematical approximations are provided for matching Gaussian laser beam profiles to the fundamental modes of step-index fibres using focal length and Rayleigh length calculations. In addition to axial methods, the module covers lateral coupling, where the overlap of evanescent fields between parallel cores leads to the excitation of symmetric and antisymmetric super-modes. This physical phenomenon is the foundation for directional couplers, where light periodically oscillates between cores over a specific coupling length. Finally, the module explores practical device applications and fabrication techniques, such as the axial pulling of heated optical fibres to create fused couplers. It explains the operation of wavelength division multiplexers (WDM), which leverage wavelength-dependent coupling lengths to separate or combine signals. The lecture concludes with an analysis of multimode interference (MMI) couplers, which are often preferred in planar integrated optics for their superior lithographic tolerance compared to traditional narrow-gap directional couplers.

AWO-08
Slides for the lecture module "Laser Resonator" in the course "Applied Wave Optics":

The lecture module explores the fundamental principles of laser resonators through the lens of wave and ray optics. It begins by defining the three essential components of a laser: the gain medium, the pump source, and the optical resonator. The transfer matrix (ABCD matrix) method is introduced as a powerful tool for analysing paraxial optical systems. By representing optical rays as vectors and components (such as mirrors, lenses, and propagation sections) as matrices, complex systems can be modelled through simple linear transformations. The method is used for a stability analysis of linear resonators. Using the eigenvalue equation of the round-trip matrix, the lecture derives the stability condition. Finally, the lecture categorises and compares various resonator configurations, including: Fabry-Perot (two flat mirrors), confocal (focal points of mirrors coincide), and concentric (spherical, centres of curvature coincide at the resonator centre). The lecture finishes with the stability diagram, providing a graphical overview of the parameter regions where optical radiation remains confined within the resonator.

AWO-09
Slides for the lecture module "Coherence" in the course "Applied Wave Optics":

The lecture module explores the fundamental concepts of optical coherence, the property of wave fields that enables interference phenomena. It distinguishes between two primary dimensions: temporal coherence, which relates to the phase correlation along the optical axis, and spatial coherence, which concerns correlations perpendicular to the axis. The lecture introduces the coherence factor and the contrast function based on autocorrelation. It provides a mathematical framework to describe the transition from incoherent to fully coherent radiation. The coherence volume is defined as the spatio-temporal region where the phase remains predictable, characterised by the coherence length and coherence time. The temporal coherence is analysed via the Michelson interferometer. The Wiener-Khinchin Theorem is used to relate the power spectral density to the autocorrelation function. Spatial coherence is investigated using Young's double-slit experiment. The van Cittert–Zernike theorem explains how the angular intensity distribution of a source determines its spatial cross-correlation, determining the far-field coherence conditions. The lecture closes by demonstrating how coherence filters (pinholes and spectral filters) can extract coherent radiation from initially incoherent sources.

AWO-10
Slides for the lecture module "Laser Threshold" in the course "Applied Wave Optics":

The lecture module examines the fundamental physics and mathematical conditions required to achieve the laser threshold, focusing on the interaction between light and matter and the resulting optical gain. The module begins by defining the three fundamental interactions between photons and electron systems: absorption, epontaneous emission, and stimulated emission. The Boltzmann and Planck distributions in thermal equilibrium reveal the relationships between the three Einstein coefficients and the impossibility of laser action in thermal equilibrium. To achieve population inversion, the module outlines different pumping configurations: Three-level lasers involve a fast non-radiative relaxation to an upper laser level but suffer from high reabsorption because the lower laser level is also the ground state. Four-level lasers are significantly more efficient because the lower laser level is separate from the ground state, allowing for easy population inversion even with low pump power. The module develops a multipath interference model to analyse the electric field within a Fabry-Pérot resonator. By treating the superposition of all waves leaving the resonator as a geometric series, the threshold gain and longitudinal modes are derived. The threshold condition is met when the optical gain exactly compensates for both intrinsic material losses and mirror transmission losses. The phase condition within the resonator allows only for specific, equidistant frequencies. The resulting laser spectrum consists of these discrete modes located where the medium's gain exceeds the threshold value.

AWO-11
Slides for the lecture module "Spectrometer and Interferometer" in the course "Applied Wave Optics":

This lecture module is dedicated to the introduction of high-precision optical measurement techniques, focusing on the practical application of interference phenomena in spectrometers and interferometers. The module begins with the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer, explaining how a Michelson-based setup uses a moving mirror to generate a spatial interferogram. It shows how a Fourier transform converts these interference patterns into wavenumber spectra, enabling the precise determination of a sample's absorption characteristics. The module then highlights some interferometric configurations: The heterodyne interferometer uses frequency-shifted laser beams and beat frequencies to measure displacement with high resolution. The Mach-Zehnder Interferometer focuses on phase-sensitive measurements using separate beam splitting and combining paths, which is of special importance in integrated optics and common-mode suppression for sensors. The Sagnac interferometer examines the phase shifts occurring between counter-propagating waves in a fibre loop, specifically for the measurement of angular velocity. The laser gyroscope contrasts the passive Sagnac effect with an active ring resonator system, where moving interference fringes allow for the tracking of angular position. The module concludes with a comparative summary, distinguishing between passive and active ring systems.
